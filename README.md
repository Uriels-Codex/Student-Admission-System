# Student-Admission-System
A simple C++ project that simulates a Student Admission and Portal System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program allows users to register students, view records, and update information. It generates and updates a .txt file to serve as a pseudo-database, enabling basic data persistence during and after program execution.
