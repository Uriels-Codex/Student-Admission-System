# 🎓 Student Admission and Portal System (C++)

This project simulates a **Student Admission and Portal System** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in C++. I developed it as my **first-year college project for my final semester** and gradually improved it across multiple versions to demonstrate my learning and implementation progress.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the `.cpp` file of your desired version in a C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio)
2. Compile and run the program
3. Follow on-screen instructions to test each feature

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Implemented key OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism (e.g., virtual methods for dynamic behavior across campus classes)
- File I/O with `.txt` files
  - Used structured .txt files as a pseudo-database to store and retrieve student, teacher, and system data
- Basic login system logic
  - Separate login processes for Admins and Students with validation and credential checking from saved files
- Menu-driven interface
  - Console-based menu navigation to interact with the system’s features step-by-step
- Pointers and Credential Updates
  - Used pointers to dynamically update admin credentials and support memory-safe access control
- Input Validation & Error Handling
  - Robust use of cin.fail(), clear(), and buffer cleaning to avoid program crashes or invalid inputs
- Polymorphic Calls
  - Used virtual functions in campus-specific classes to demonstrate flexible and scalable method overriding
